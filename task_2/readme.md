Task
Change your Email class so that the initialize method takes a subject string and a headers hash.

This is then more in line with how actual emails are stored in the real world. The values against date and from are stored in a hash, which is called the email headers.

Note: This requires making some changes to the methods in the Email class as well as the line that instantiates the email object.

Complete the definition of the Email class so that you get the same output as before.

Expected output
Your code should output the following:
